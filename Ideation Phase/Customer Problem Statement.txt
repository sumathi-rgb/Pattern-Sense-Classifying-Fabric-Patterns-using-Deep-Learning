📄 Customer Problem Statement



✏ Purpose:
Create a clear problem statement from the customer's perspective to deeply understand their challenges and guide the design of meaningful, user-centered solutions.

✅ Customer Problem Statement
“As a textile business owner, designer, or seller,
I need a fast, accurate, and automated way to classify fabric patterns,
because manual classification is slow, subjective, and often inconsistent,
which leads to errors in product catalogs, delays in listing, and reduced customer satisfaction.”

✅ Why this problem matters to customers:
Manual tagging takes time, increasing operational costs.

Inconsistent pattern classification confuses buyers and affects brand trust.

Small textile businesses often lack technical teams to automate this process.

✅ Impact on customer’s daily work:
Wasted time reviewing each image individually.

Difficulty maintaining large, accurate online catalogs.

Limited scalability as product collections grow.

✅ Customer’s goals:
Speed up cataloging and reduce manual effort.

Ensure consistent, professional product presentation.

Scale operations without hiring more manual staff.
