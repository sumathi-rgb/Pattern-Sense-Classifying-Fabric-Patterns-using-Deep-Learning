Project design phase

Date: 18 July 2025
Team id:LTVIP2025TMID37852
Project Name: Pattern Sense: Classifying Fabric Patterns Using Deep Learning

âœ… Data Flow Diagrams
A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) shows how data flows through the system, including inputs, processes, data stores, and outputs.

Example: DFD Level 0 (Simplified)
User uploads fabric image

System preprocesses image

Deep Learning Model predicts pattern class (e.g., floral, geometric, abstract)

Result displayed to User

Optionally, data saved to Pattern Database for future analysis

USER Stories

| User Type              | Functional Requirement (Epic) | User Story Number | User Story / Task                                                  | Acceptance Criteria                         | Priority |  Release |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | -------: | -------: |
| Customer (Mobile user) | Registration                  |             USN-1 | As a user, I can register in the app using email and password      | I can access my dashboard after registering |     High | Sprint-1 |
|                        |                               |             USN-2 | As a user, I receive a confirmation email after registering        | I can click confirm and activate account    |     High | Sprint-1 |
|                        |                               |             USN-3 | As a user, I can register through Google/Facebook login            | I can access dashboard via social login     |   Medium | Sprint-2 |
| Login                  |                               |             USN-4 | As a user, I can log in using email/password                       | I can see my dashboard                      |     High | Sprint-1 |
| Fabric Classification  |                               |             USN-5 | As a user, I can upload an image of fabric to classify its pattern | System shows correct predicted pattern      |     High | Sprint-1 |
|                        |                               |             USN-6 | As a user, I can view history of my past uploads and predictions   | See previous patterns and dates             |   Medium | Sprint-2 |
|                        |                               |             USN-7 | As a user, I can delete any past upload record                     | Selected record removed from history        |      Low | Sprint-3 |
