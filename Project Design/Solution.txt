|     1 | **Problem Statement (Problem to be solved)** | Identifying and classifying fabric patterns (e.g., floral, geometric, abstract) is time-consuming and subjective for designers, manufacturers, and sellers. Manual methods often lead to inconsistent classification, slowing product cataloging and affecting quality control. |
|     2 | **Idea / Solution description**              | Develop an AI-powered web application where users can upload fabric images. A deep learning (CNN) model classifies the pattern automatically into predefined categories, displays the result instantly, and keeps a history for future reference.                               |
|     3 | **Novelty / Uniqueness**                     | Unlike generic image classifiers, this solution is specialized and trained on a curated fabric dataset, offering higher accuracy and domain-specific predictions. The dashboard adds usability for both designers and businesses.                                               |
|     4 | **Social Impact / Customer Satisfaction**    | Reduces manual effort and errors, speeds up product listing, and helps small textile businesses and artisans digitize and classify their designs, supporting fair trade and cultural preservation.                                                                              |
|     5 | **Business Model (Revenue Model)**           | Freemium model: Free basic classification for individual users; paid plans for businesses offering bulk upload, detailed analytics, and API integration into ERP/e-commerce systems.                                                                                            |
|     6 | **Scalability of the Solution**              | Solution built on modular cloud architecture: can scale to process thousands of images daily, add new pattern classes, and serve global textile businesses through a multilingual interface.                                                                                    |
